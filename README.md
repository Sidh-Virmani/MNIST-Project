# 🧠 MNIST Digit Classifier

A simple implementation of a Neural Network to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.  
This project is part of the **DevSoc Core Inductions 2025** at **BITS Pilani, Goa Campus**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains:
- A neural network implementation from scratch (no TensorFlow `used).
- Training on the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale digit images).
- Evaluation of model accuracy on test data.
- Visualizations using Matplotlib.
- Modular code for reusability and clarity.


## 📊 Features Implemented


✔️ Forward and Backward Propagation

✔️ ReLU and Softmax activation functions

✔️ Cross-entropy loss

✔️ Gradient Descent Optimization

✔️ Training/Validation accuracy tracking

✔️ Matplotlib visualizations

✔️ Clean code structure and modularity

## 🎯 Learning Objectives


Through this project, I aimed to:

- Strengthen my understanding of neural networks.

- Implement low-level NN components without high-level APIs.

- Learn to manage a Python project with modular code.

- Use Git effectively for version control.
